	<p><img src="UMSI.JPEG" class = "right"/>Here is the top section.  It should take up the entire top, and have the UMSI logo floating on the right side.</p>
</section>
<section id = "middle">
	<p>This is the middle section.  It lists a few reasons this lab is important:
		<ol>
			<li>You learn that the order of linked style sheets matters</li>
			<li>You get to practice fixing common validation errors</li>
			<li> You figure out how to put the numbers back into an ordered list.
		<ol>
			No part of the logo should be in this section, regardless of viewport size.  So make sure to check it out on the large screen.  And be sure to validate AFTER you upload as well.

<footer>
Here is the footer.  I am putting in copyright Colleen van Lent, but there isn't really anything proprietary in here.  This should be at the bottom of the page.
